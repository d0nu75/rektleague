<h2>What is The Rekt League?</h2>
<img class="img1" src="/static/stats/rekt-party-group.jpg">
<p>The Rekt League is a competitive <em>League of Legends</em> community for players who are looking more from the game than the traditional ladder climb. Over the course of a 7-week regular season and 3-week playoffs, 8 teams duke it out in a best of 2 format. But really The Rekt League is a lot more than that. It&rsquo;s the players, the community, the casters, the memes, and the experiences that come with playing a game competitively. Storylines form as the seasons progress, history is written each game, outplays are praised, misplays are common. We by no means are the best players in the game, but over the course of the season you&rsquo;re forced to grow as a team and player or find yourself being outclassed. Being part of The Rekt League is more than just an online experience we want to give players the chance to meet, interact, and celebrate with each other at our end of season awards parties. It&rsquo;s one thing to talk to people online you don&rsquo;t know, but in our opinion it&rsquo;s an even more rewarding experience to meet the people you&rsquo;ve played against and with for week</p>

<h2>Why Join?</h2>
